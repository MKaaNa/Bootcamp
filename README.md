# (Bootcamp) Heart Disease Prediction

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on various health metrics using supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.

## Project Steps:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Model Selection (Logistic Regression)
4. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score)
5. Unsupervised Learning (K-Means Clustering)

The dataset used is the [Heart Disease UCI Dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/redwankarimsony/heart-disease-data)).
